The **motherboard** is a PCB that serves as the core of a GCC's internals. It connects the various electrical components to the processor, which is responsible for communicating with the console/adapter via the [cable](/compendium/cables). There are also three **daughterboards** connected to the motherboard: the C-stick board and two [trigger](/compendium/triggers) boards (also commonly called trigger paddles).

## OEM variants

There have been several major revisions of the motherboard that correspond with the [stickbox variants](/compendium/sticks/stickboxes#variants).

### T1

The earliest GCC motherboards. The oldest of these often have a green back, which makes them easy to recognize. T1 boards use a detachable connector for the C-stick board. The corresponding T1 stickboxes are soldered on.

### T2

The second-generation board eschews the detachable C-stick cable and adds a large blue oscillator that is the hallmark recognizable feature. The T2 stickboxes are also soldered on.

### T3

The most recent revision's most notable change is the swap to T3 stickboxes which are attached via screws instead of soldering. Some of the earliest T3 boards also have a detachable C-stick connector again for some reason.

## Aftermarket boards

In more recent years, several projects have created replacement motherboards for GCCs that feature programmability and various other features.

### Goomwave

The first well-known aftermarket motherboard was the Goomwave, which features hot-swappable [stickbox potentiometers](/compendium/sticks/pots), [notch](/compendium/shells/mods/notches) calibration, [pode](/compendium/sticks/pots#pode) emulation, and various other customizable settings. At the project's peak, many top Melee players used a Goomwave, and demand far outstripped supply since the project was closed-source and only the maintainers could produce the boards. More recently, the Goomwave project has been more dormant in the wake of PhobGCC's growing popularity.

### PhobGCC

The PhobGCC project consists of an open-source PCB design paired with open-source firmware, designed to be fabricated, assembled and flashed by anyone. It replaces the OEM [stickbox potentiometers](/compendium/sticks/pots) with magnets and Hall effect sensors, and supports many customizable settings like stick calibration, built-in [snapback](/compendium/sticks/stickboxes#common-issues) filtering, button swaps, [digital trigger](/compendium/triggers/mods/digital) emulation, and much more.
