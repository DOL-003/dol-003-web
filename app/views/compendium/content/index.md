## Who this is for

Compendium content is meant for anyone interested in GCC modding, whether you're shopping for a controller or modding one yourself. You will find a mix of high-level overviews and recommendations, and in-depth technical information and tutorials.

## Where to start

The [mod index & glossary](/compendium/mods) is a good place to get an idea of what mods are out there, and to familiarize yourself with GCC terminology.

There are also several [general guides](/compendium/guides) with recommendations for common stuff like controller shopping and troubleshooting.
