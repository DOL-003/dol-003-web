  <p>An OEM thumbstick and C-stick</p>
</aside>

The **primary thumbstick** on the left side of the controller is a medium to light gray ABS plastic with a circle-textured rubber cap. The **C-stick** is yellow ABS plastic with a rubber cap imprinted with the letter "C".

## Common issues & repairs

The most common issue with thumbsticks is wear. Over time, the ridges on the rubber cap typically wear away due to friction, and sometimes even tear or completely come off with excessive use.

It is possible, though somewhat difficult, to replace a worn rubber cap, but usually the entire stick is replaced instead.

## Replacements

There is no consistent source for standalone OEM sticks, new or used, except for other GCCs. Resin sticks are a popular alternative, especially because they can be made in practically any color, with or without OEM-like rubber caps.

### Where to get OEM sticks

- Other GameCube controllers
- Modders occasionally sell overstock

Thumbsticks from certain other Nintendo controllers are compatible with GCC stickboxes, and some players even prefer the alternate feel they have.

- **Wii Nunchuck sticks** fit in a GCC, but are taller than standard GCC sticks and have a slightly different rubber cap design.
- **Wii Classic Controller sticks** fit in a GCC and have the same rubber cap design as nunchuck sticks.
- **Resin sticks** are available in many varieties, from OEM profile to custom shapes like Spicy Sticks, which are often recommended for players who prefer a grippier surface. Resin sticks are made with and without OEM-like rubber caps.

### Sticks to avoid

Many online retailers sell knockoff GCC thumbsticks, which are typically very cheaply made and ill-fitting, and often don't last more than a few weeks with regular use. These sticks are usually made to look very similar to OEM ones, so always be sure you're getting actual OEM or hand-casted resin before purchasing.
