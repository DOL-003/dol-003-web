  <p>An OEM thumbstick and C-stick</p>
</aside>

The primary thumbstick on the left side of the controller is a medium to light gray ABS plastic with a circle-textured rubber cap. The C-stick is yellow ABS plastic with a rubber cap imprinted with the letter "C".

## Replacements

There is no consistent source for standalone OEM sticks, new or used, except for other GCCs. Resin sticks are a popular alternative, especially because they can be made in practically any color, with or without OEM-like rubber caps.

### OEM

- Other GameCube controllers
- Modders occasionally sell overstock

### Other good options

Thumbsticks from certain other Nintendo controllers are compatible with GCC stickboxes, and some players even prefer the alternate feel they have.

- Wii Nunchuck sticks
- Wii Classic Controller sticks
- Resin sticks

### Bad options

Many online retailers sell knockoff GCC thumbsticks, which are typically very cheaply made and ill-fitting, and often don't last more than a few weeks with regular use. These sticks are usually made to look very similar to OEM ones, so always be sure you're getting actual OEM or hand-casted resin before purchasing.

- Amazon
- eBay
- Etsy (except for handmade resin ones)
- Retro gaming shops (except for handmade resin ones)
