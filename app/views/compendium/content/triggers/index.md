  <p>A set of OEM triggers.</p>
</aside>

The **triggers** are shoulder buttons on either side of a GCC designed to be pulled with an index or middle finger. The triggers themselves are ABS plastic like the other buttons, but the underlying mechanism is more complex, allowing a larger range of motion and actuating both analog and digital inputs. The left trigger is referred to as the **L button**, while the right trigger is referred to as the **R button**.

The trigger assembly is one of the more complicated moving parts in a GameCube controller, consisting of several pieces including a graduated slider potentiometer that enables a range of analog inputs proportional to how far the trigger is pressed, as well as a silicone button pad and contact pad (on the corresponding [trigger daughterboard](/compendium/boards)) to activate a digital input when the trigger is fully pressed.
