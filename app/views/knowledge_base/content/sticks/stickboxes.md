title: Stickboxes
description: The mechanical component of the analog stick assembly.

The stickbox is the mechanism that lets you smoothly move an analog stick around, and returns it to center when pressure is released.

## Variants

There are three iterations of stickboxes found in GCCs, as well as stickboxes made by third parties.

### T1

Found on the earliest GCCs, these stickboxes are known to [wear](#common-issues) very quickly, resulting in very loose analog sticks. T1s consist of plastic innards housed in a metal outer case, which is attached to the motherboard by four solder joints.

### T2

An improved version of the T1 that lasts much longer, but shares most aspects of the design.

### T3

A major all-plastic redesign that lasts much longer than the earlier variants. It attaches to the motherboard via 2 small screws. This design is also much easier to disassemble, which is another reason modders typically prefer them â€” it is much easier to clean them, lube them, and replace the springs in them.

### Third-party

No third-party stickboxes have been found which compare to T3s, and they are generally seen as inferior to OEM stickboxes and not worth buying or using.

## Common issues

The main problem encountered with stickboxes is wear, which impacts how well the stick returns to center. As a stickbox wears, a physical dead zone develops in the center where the stick feels loose, and in severe cases can cause misinputs.

There is a common misconception that this wear is caused by weakened springs, but it's actually due to the breakdown of the plastic components inside the stickbox assembly. This wear is unavoidable and unrepairable, and typically a stickbox is replaced once the looseness becomes noticeable.
