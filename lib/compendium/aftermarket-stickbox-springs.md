**Aftermarket stickbox springs** are replacement stickbox springs with different characteristics from stock springs. Stock springs tend to feel stiff to many players, and can also provide uneven resistance in different directions due to the non-uniform design of the spring. Swapping the spring can solve either or both of these issues.

The idea of using a different spring for stickboxes was popularized by FIRES, who coined the term **slickbox** (stylized SLICKbox) to describe the mod with the parts he selected.

Swapping the spring is a relatively quick mod on a T3 stickbox, and is not recommended on other stickboxes. It is also often recommended to [clean and re-lube](/analog-stick/stick-mods/stickbox-lubing) the stickbox while you have it open, if it hasn't been done recently.

There are two popular options for the replacement spring:

- The [Smalley L1](https://www.mcmaster.com/1561T1/) spring used in the SLICKbox mod provides more even resistance across different directions due to its flat ends. It must be paired with a shim to provide enough resistance to reliably return the GCC analog stick to center, but even so it provides noticeably less tension than the stock spring. Different shim sizes provide different amounts of tension according to preference.
- The [Smalley L2](https://www.mcmaster.com/1561T2/) spring is a slightly longer version of the L1 that feels more like the stock spring, but more even across directions since it shares its design with the L1.

There are no known sources for these springs other than McMaster-Carr.

The original [FIRES SLICKbox guide](https://firescc.com/mod-guides#/fires-slickbox) is a great walkthrough with lots of photos, no matter which spring you decide to try.
