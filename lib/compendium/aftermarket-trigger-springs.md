**Aftermarket trigger springs** are non-stock springs that fits into the OEM [trigger](/triggers) assembly. Various aftermarket springs are used to change the feel of a trigger, usually in the interest of reducing the force needed to press it. [Shortening the stock spring](/triggers/trigger-mods/trigger-spring-trimming) can have a similar effect.

## Parts

There are multiple options for replacement springs:

- [Rienne springs](https://www.riennecustoms.com/shop/aftermarket-gamecube-controller-trigger-springs-set-of-2-pre-lubed/)
- [FIRES springs](https://www.thespringstore.com/pc017-453-12300-sst-1500-c-n-in.html) (bulk only)

## Process

Since the replacement springs fit the OEM trigger assembly, simply disassemble the trigger assembly, swap in the new spring, and reassemble the assembly.
