**Mouse-click buttons** are a mod to change the feel of face buttons, the Z button, or a trigger's digital press by soldering in mouse-click switches for actuation.

## Parts

Various switches are available. These are some of the most common choices.

- D2LS-21 (61gf)
- D2LS-11 (122gf)
- Kailh Mini Side Mounted (L) Microswitch â€” for Z buttons

Additionally, various brackets exist both for sale and as STLs for 3D printing (see the guide linked below).

## Process

The switch is soldered to either the button contacts, the trigger board contacts, or the Z button joints.

For buttons, the bottoms of the buttons need to be flattened either by plugging them with a flat insert (for OEM buttons), or sanding them flat (for resin buttons).

For the Z button, depending on the installation method, a bracket is used to brace the switch.

For triggers, the trigger assembly is modified or replaced by a custom part that accommodates the shape of the switch.

The [PhobGCC](/boards#phobgcc) board has face button contacts and trigger contacts specially designed for soldering the D2LS switches to. For OEM controllers, button pad traces need to be manually exposed to use as solder points.
