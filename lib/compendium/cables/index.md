title: Cables
subtitle: Every GCC has a cable that connects the controller to a GameCube, Wii, or PC (via a USB adapter).

An OEM GCC **cable** consists of a twisted set of five insulated wires with a drain wire, a layer of copper shielding, and an outer layer of rubber insulation. The controller-side end connects directly to the [motherboard](/boards) via a soldered connector, while the console-side end terminates in a proprietary Nintendo-designed plug.

Stock cables come in two lengths. Smash Ultimate, Smash 4, and JP White controllers have 3 meter cables. All other controllers have 2 meter cables. All OEM cables have black insulation, except for the white Smash 4 and JP White controllers, which have white insulation. Various plug cover colors exist that correspond with [shell](/shells) colors.

## Common issues & repairs

Cable wear is a frequent cause of general controller issues like disconnects and dropped inputs. The insulation can also tear open, revealing the copper shielding and wires within. Cable damage is often caused by repeatedly tightly wrapping the cable around the controller.

Generally, repairing worn cables is not seen as worthwhile since diagnosis can be difficult, future reliability of the cable will always be in question, and full replacements are typically readily available.

Another common cause of cable issues is poor soldering of the cable to the motherboard, which can usually be fixed by reflowing the joints or desoldering and resoldering more carefully.

## Replacements

There is no known source for standalone OEM cables, but many modders have extra cables on hand from other controllers. Additionally, GCC-compatible cables can be [made from scratch](/cables/mods/liquid), and cheap third-party ones can be found on sites like AliExpress (though these are not recommended due to quality issues).
