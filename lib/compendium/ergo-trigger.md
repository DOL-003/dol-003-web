</aside>

**Ergo trigger** (short for **ergonomic trigger**) is an informal designation of resin trigger with a modified shape — generally, one with smoothed, reduced or removed front and/or back ridges. Many GCC users find these smoother shapes more comfortable to use, particularly those who tend to grip the buttons toward either edge.
