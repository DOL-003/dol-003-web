**Ergo triggers** (short for **ergonomic triggers**) are [resin](/resin-casting) [triggers](/triggers) with a modified shape — generally, one with smoothed, reduced or removed front and/or back ridges. Many GCC users find these smoother shapes more comfortable to use, particularly those who tend to grip the buttons toward either edge.
