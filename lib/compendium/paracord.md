A **paracord**, short for **paracorded cable**, is a [cable](/cable) with braided nylon paracord sleeving instead of rubber sleeving. Creating paracords is sometimes referred to as **paracording**.

## Parts

- An OEM cable
- A matching length of 550 paracord

Some popular places to get inexpensive paracord are [Paracord Planet](https://paracordplanet.com), [Paracord Galaxy](https://paracordgalaxy.com), and local hardware or craft stores.

It is highly recommended to use 550 paracord, and to avoid paracord with metallic tracers as these are known to have fit issues when sleeving.

## Process

There are many methods for making paracord cables, but generally the process is roughly:

1. **Desolder** the cable from the controller.
1. **Remove the rubber insulation** from the cable using a craft knife or similar.
1. Optionally, **remove the copper shielding** from the cable.
1. Either **remove the pins** from the connector and tape them tightly to the cable, or **cut off the controller-side end** entirely.
1. **Cut a length of paracord** slightly longer than the cable.
1. **Sleeve the paracord** over the entire cable. Various methods for this exist:
   - Feeding the paracord over the cable end by hand by pushing and pulling about a centimeter at a time
   - Heat-shrinking a small object like a screwdriver shaft to the cable end and feeding the paracord over that
   - Heat-shrinking or taping the cable to the inner nylon strands of the paracord and using them to pull the cable through
1. If the controller-side end was cut off, **re-crimp new pins**.
1. **Reattach the pins** to the connector.
1. **Solder** the connector to the controller.
