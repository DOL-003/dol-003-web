## Tri-point Y 3.0 / Microstix 1 (for shell screws)

To open a GCC, you need to remove the 6 tri-point [shell](/shell) screws. Here are some recommendations for suitable screwdrivers:

- Wera 030084 Microstix 1 ([KC Tool](https://www.kctool.com/wera-030084-1-x-40mm-esd-safe-microstix-precision-screwdriver/), [Kadano](https://kadano.biz/premium-quality-wera-microstix-1-tripoint-triwing-magnetic-screwdriver-for-nintendo-gamecube-controllers/)) — premium option
- WLXY tri-point ([Kadano](https://kadano.biz/high-quality-wlxy-tripoint-triwing-magnetic-screwdriver-for-nintendo-gamecube-controllers/)) — good budget option
- [Battle Beaver tri-point](https://battlebeavercustoms.com/products/triwing) — decent budget option

Most tri-point Y 3.0 or Y 2.5 drivers you can find will work, though quality can vary significantly which impacts how easy it is to work with the shell screws without camming out or stripping them. Generally, the more premium options are recommended for modders who frequently disassemble and assemble controllers, while cheaper options usually suffice for occasional work.

Note that "tri-wing" is technically a different specification, though many screwdriver manufacturers and even modders use the term "tri-wing" to describe tri-point drivers.

## Phillips PH1 (for trigger screws)

- Wiha 261P PicoFinish PH1 ([Wiha](https://www.wihatools.com/products/picofinish-precision-phillips-1-x-60mm), [Kadano](https://kadano.biz/wiha-picofinish-ph0-ph1-screwdriver-for-gcc-trigger-stickbox-screws/)) — premium option
- Wera 030112 PH #1 ([KC Tool](https://www.kctool.com/wera-030112-ph-1-x-80mm-esd-safe-phillips-precision-screwdriver/)) — premium option

Most other PH1 drivers will work, but trigger screws are especially sensitive to camming out and can strip very easily, so quality options like these are highly recommended.

## Phillips PH0 (for stickbox screws)

- Wiha 261P PicoFinish PH0 ([Wiha](https://www.wihatools.com/products/picofinish-precision-phillips-0-x-50mm), [Kadano](https://kadano.biz/wiha-picofinish-ph0-ph1-screwdriver-for-gcc-trigger-stickbox-screws/) — premium option
- Wera 030111 PH #0 ([KC Tool](https://www.kctool.com/wera-030111-ph-0-x-60mm-esd-safe-phillips-precision-screwdriver/)) — premium option

Stickbox screws are easier to work with and don't need to be tightened very tightly, so various drivers can work, even similar sizes like PH00.
