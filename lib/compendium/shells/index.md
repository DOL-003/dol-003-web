title: Shells
subtitle: The outer plastic housing of a GameCube controller is known as the shell.
---

The **shell** of a GameCube controller consists of two injection-molded ABS halves, commonly referred to as the **front shell** and the **back shell**, fastened together by six screws. The front shell has openings for the face [buttons](/compendium/buttons) and [analog sticks](/compendium/sticks), while the back shell has openings for each of the [triggers](/compendium/triggers). The Z button slots between the two halves in an opening formed by matching contours in the edges of each half. The shell is responsible for securely housing the [motherboard](/compendium/boards).

## Variants

Nintendo has produced about two dozen different shell designs since the release of the GameCube in 2001:

- Indigo
- Black
- Spice Orange
- Indigo + Clear
- Panasonic SH-TGC10
- Platinum
- Emerald Blue
- Crystal White
- Symphonic Green
- Hanshin Tigers
- Gundam Char
- Club Nintendo
- Starlight Gold
- Mario
- Clear
- Luigi
- Resident Evil 4
- Wario
- Pearl White
- White
- Smash 4 Black
- Smash 4 White
- Smash Ultimate

All shells share an identical shape and size, though tolerances have shifted very subtly over the years. Because of this, shells from different controller generations sometimes don't fit together completely flush.

Most OEM shells are uncoated and the color is the color of the underlying plastic. However, some shells (notably Platinum, Pearl White and Crystal White) are painted, resulting in a slightly different feel. Unfortunately, the paint is not protected by clear coat or any other protectant, so it tends to wear off easily with normal use.

Smash Ultimate shells are the most recent design produced, and have a slightly more textured finish than past shells.

## Common issues & repairs

Shells often accumulate wear & tear from use, and there's typically not much that can be done about scratches, scuffs, dents or other damage. Some marks can be removed with a magic eraser. Shells with a worn finish are often considered good candidates for [painting](/compendium/shells/mods/painting).

Over-tightening screws can easily lead to screw posts breaking off the top shell. Sometimes these can be superglued back into place, though durability takes a big hit, so the problem is often ignored or the shell is replaced.

OEM shells can only be obtained from other GCCs, but there are a number of third party options of varying quality that are compatible with OEM internals.

- So-called "Ali shells" are very inexpensive [on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805693064809.html){:target="\_blank"}. These are also called "Controller Chaos" or "CC" shells because the injection molds used to make them are believed to be from Controller Chaos (the early ones sold on AliExpress had the Controller Chaos logo molded into the shell).
- [eXtremeRate](https://extremerate.com/collections/nintendo-gamecube-shells){:target="\_blank"} sells GCC shells in various colors and finishes.
- [Foxpad Customs](https://foxpadcustoms.com){:target="\_blank"} sells OEM-compatible clear shells with various tints.
