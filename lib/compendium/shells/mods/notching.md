**Notching** is the process of changing the shape of the [analog stick](/compendium/sticks) gate by adding new corner-like features, known as **notches**, in specific places. The exact location of each notch is designed to achieve certain coordinates that correspond to certain tech in a Smash game.

## Variants

There are many types of notches (see Kadano's reference linked below) but these are some of the most common.

### Wavedash notches

These are designed to help the player hit the maximum (and optionally minimum) wavedash angles.

### Firefox notches

These expand on wavedash notches by adding similar notches near all 4 cardinal directions, which helps Fox and Falco hit otherwise-difficult angles with their Up-B.

### Shield drop notches

These lowered the bottom corner notches to make shield dropping more consistent, but have largely been made unnecessary by the universal adoption of UCF.
