**Stickbox lubing** is the process of adding lubricant to specific places on the inside of a [stickbox](/analog-sticks/stick-components/stickboxes). As with any moving mechanical part, friction is a common cause of wear and inconsistent movement in stickboxes. Lubing a stickbox with an appropriate grease is a straightforward way to reduce friction and improve the feel for a reasonably long time.

## Parts

It's important to choose a grease that's both compatible with the materials it will come in contact with, and appropriately formulated for the load profile of a stickbox. There are two commonly-recommended options:

- [Molykote 44 Light](https://www.dupont.com/products/molykote-44-light-high-temperature-grease.html) is the traditional choice, in use by many modders for a number of years.

- [Krytox GPL 215](https://www.krytox.com/en/-/media/files/krytox/krytox-gpl-105-205-215-225.pdf?rev=82945e8528154d6d9b17636cdd8e22e9&hash=C686C2FB3A2E4CA6ABF1F963AE3BA435) is a more recently-identified option that may result in an even smoother feel than Molykote 44, but contains a compound that gives it a charcoal-like appearance that some people find undesirable.

Both of these greases can be difficult to source and/or fairly expensive. Some listings for smaller amounts may be available on Amazon, and historically some modders have acquired it in bulk and resold it pre-loaded in syringes on Etsy and elsewhere.

While these are the most researched and recommended greases for use in stickboxes, many others may be nearly as effective, with variances in feel, longevity, etc.

## Process

To fully lube a T3 stickbox, it should be completely disassembled and cleaned with soap and water or isopropyl alcohol, and then the selected grease is applied (usually with a syringe) to specific friction points as it is reassembled. T1 and T2 stickboxes cannot be easily disassembled, so generally grease is applied to a more limited set of friction points accessible from the top of the stickbox.

## Resources

The [FIRES stickbox lubrication guide](https://firescc.com/mod-guides#/stickbox-lubrication-guide) is an excellent walkthrough of the process with annotated photos to highlight the friction points to target with grease.
