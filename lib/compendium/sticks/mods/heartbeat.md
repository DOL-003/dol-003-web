title: Heartbeat modules
subtitle: Resolve both snapback and PODE with a combination of capacitors and resistors.
---

Brand new analog sticks usually have [snapback](/compendium/sticks/stickboxes#snapback), and as potentiometers wear, they tend to develop [PODE](/compendium/misc/pode). A **heartbeat module** is a set of adjustable capacitors and resistors designed to mitigate both of these unwanted effects.

## How it works

Just like a standard [snapback module], capacitors are used to smooth out unwanted inputs caused by the analog stick overshooting the return to center due to the tension of the stickbox spring. A heartbeat module adds resistors that selectively drain built-up discharge within the potentiometer, removing the variance in current throughput caused by PODE.

## Parts

Heartbeat modules are available from several sellers. Note that availability may vary.

- [Rienne heartbeat module](https://www.riennecustoms.com/shop/heartbeat-module-preorder-pre-assembled-soldering-required/) — the original module by [Rienne](/modders/rienne-customs), the pioneer of the heartbeat module
- [RockerGaming heartbeat module](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1599189488) — the same module sold by Rocker, a collaborator on the original project
- [Heartbeat daughter module](https://kadano.biz/kadano-gcc-resistance-heartbeat-daughter-module-only-for-s2e-snapback-modules-and-tb-trigger-modules/) by [Kadano](/modders/kadano) (for use with Kadano's snapback module)
- [Open Heartbeat Module](https://github.com/Savestate2A03/open-heartbeat-module) — an open-source module design you can order from JLCPCB, by [Savestate](/modders/savestate)

## Process

Installing a heartbeat module is basically identical to installing a snapback module, and involves soldering the module to the [motherboard](/compendium/boards). Make sure to follow the instructions included with the module.
