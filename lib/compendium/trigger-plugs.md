A **trigger plug** is a small spacer inserted into a trigger's shaft that shortens the overall travel distance of the trigger, making it quicker to activate the digital press at the bottom of the travel. A trigger plug that removes almost all of the travel is called a **long plug** or **tall plug**, while a plug that removes around half the travel is called a **short plug**.

Because Smash Ultimate does not read a trigger's digital input by default, players who want to use trigger plugs typically need to also use the [digital trigger mod](/triggers/trigger-mods/digital-triggers) to remap the digital press to an analog input. Similarly, tall plugs negate the usefulness of the analog input, which means a trigger with a tall plug cannot be used for light shielding in Melee unless the digital press is remapped to activate an analog value instead.

## Parts

Trigger plugs are typically 3D printed, which means they can be purchased or printed at home.

## Process

1. Open the controller.
2. Remove the silicone trigger pad from the trigger.
3. Press the trigger all the way down and insert the plug into the bottom of the trigger, making sure it is fully seated.
4. Replace the silicone pad.

Sometimes a trigger plug may fit loosely in the trigger shaft. To fix this, pad it out with a small piece of tape or something similar before inserting.

To remove a plug, it's easiest to disassemble the trigger assembly in order to get a good grip on the plug to pull it out. Sometimes a small pair of pliers can be useful if the plug is particularly stuck â€” just be careful not to damage the trigger.
