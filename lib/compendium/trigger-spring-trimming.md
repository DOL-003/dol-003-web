**Trigger spring trimming** is the process of shortening the stock spring inside a [trigger](/triggers) to make it easier to press. One of the most common complaints about the GameCube controller is hand fatigue caused by the large range of motion and relatively high resistance of the triggers. In addition to (or instead of) mods like [pad perforation](/triggers/trigger-mods/pad-perforation) or [trigger plugs](/triggers/trigger-mods/trigger-plugs), a trigger's springs can be shortened (or [replaced](/triggers/trigger-mods/aftermarket-trigger-springs)) to make it lighter to pull.

## Parts

- Wiresnips or flush cutters (if modifying OEM springs)
- Lighter (if modifying OEM springs)

## Process

To trim OEM springs, simply choose a length and cut them with wiresnips. Flush cutters can also work, but may be damaged by the steel spring in the process. If you're not sure how much to trim, iteratively cut off a small amount at a time (about one full twist of the spring) and repeatedly test it to determine when it gives the desired resistance.

Once the spring is trimmed, heat the trimmed end of it with a lighter until the steel turns red, and carefully push it against a heat-safe surface to flatten the end of the spring like the end you cut off. This will ensure it sits flush and secure inside the trigger assembly.
