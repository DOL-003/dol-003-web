A trigger can be **lubed** to make the act of pulling it feel smoother and quieter. This is done by applying a specialized grease to various locations within the trigger assembly.

## Parts

- Krytox 205g0 or similar non-silicone grease
- Small fine brush
- Cotton swab

## Process

1. Completely disassemble the trigger.
2. Use a small brush to apply a very light amount of lubricant to the inside (and optionally the outside) of the trigger tube. If you can see any accumulation of grease, there's too much and it should be wiped off with the brush.
3. Optionally, lubricate the spring as well. This may reduce spring noise and vibration. Compress the spring between your thumb and forefinger, and use the brush to lightly coat the entirety of the spring.
4. Reassemble the trigger, but do not replace the silicone pad.
5. Pull the trigger a few times, and use a cotton swab to wipe away any resulting grease accumulation around the opening of the trigger tube.
6. Replace the silicone pad and reassemble the controller.
